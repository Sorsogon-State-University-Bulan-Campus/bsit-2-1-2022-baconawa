# __🚗Eveything about Vangelyn's Food Restaurant!__

Traditionally, people had to make calls to place orders or drive to the restaurants for a take-out, then wait for the food to be prepared and delivered. Sometimes, placing an order on the phone means that there could be mistakes in order. Clearly, these aren't really the best solutions to order food from restaurants especially for people with busy lifestyles.
